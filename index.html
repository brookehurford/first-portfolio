              <h3>Dream Vacation</h3>
              <p>On day four at Epicodus, my partner Taylor and I created a website for our dream vacation. To build this we used the bootstrap framework as well as HTML and CSS.</p>

              <p>On day three at Epicodus, my partner Michael and I created a blog about elephants. To build this blog we used HTML and CSS, and we also played around with some Media Quieries.</p>

              <h3>Animal Shelter</h3>
              <p>Animals are the best, so Michael and I also created a site for an animal shelter. We used HTML and CSS to build the site. We practiced using our stylesheet a lot here to make columns for each animal.</p>

            <p class="lead">My yellow brick road to coding</p>
            <p>I can still hear my mom in my head saying, "You should do something with computers". Flash forward 15 years and I've had graduated high school, moved to Eugene to pursue Dental Hygiene, and once I figured out that path definitely wasn't me - I landed on full-time server. At that point in my life I loved it, but I knew it would fulfill me forever.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2011 I decided it was time to move back to Portland, and get a job with my cousin at SightWorks. To be honest - I had little to no idea what they actually did. Turns out they built websites. During the next four years I found my love of this industry. The people, the energy, the learning, the building. As a Project Manager at SightWorks I learned more than I could have ever hoped for. I found that my absolute favorite part of my job was working with my team. Getting in a room, figuring out a problem, and solving it - together. That's when I decided programming could really be for me.</p>

            <p class="lead">What I love</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>My family.</em> To me this includes blood, and non-blood family.</li>
              <li><em>Festivals.</em> Music, community, love - what else could you ask for?</li>
              <li><em>Blogging.</em> This is a new one for me, but the more I think about it - the more I wonder why I haven't been doing it all along.</li>
